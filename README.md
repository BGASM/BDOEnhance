Script to run enhancement sims

Simple python script to run enhancement simulations on Black Gem gear. Fail stacks are fixed, so each attempt has a fixed probability.

This script has the most recent (as of upload) market prices for Black Gems. All simulations are based on Loggia gear probabilities and enhance materials, but it should be clear where to sub your own for Manos.

The goal of this script was to figure out cost estimates for enhancing life mastery equipment, and to gauge profitability of enhancing for silver.
